### This mod is currently under development.

## Reason for Creation
The number of lightweight mods for Forge 1.8.9 is very limited compared to other versions. 
This mod was created to address the issue where players with low-spec PCs who enjoy 1.8.9 PvP cannot play on Forge.

## FPS
The FPS increase will vary depending on the user's PC specifications. For reference:

If your average FPS is 30, this mod might increase it to 60.
If your average FPS is 45, this mod might increase it to 70.
Please note that the exact increase will vary.

## How does it work?
### Unnecessary Particle Removal
- Off-screen Particles
- Occluded Particles
- Distant Particles
### Block Optimization
- Don't load blocks completely surrounded by other blocks.
